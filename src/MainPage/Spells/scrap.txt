At the end of the spell, choose one of the following benefits: -Add one hit die to the pool, this die is equal to the smallest one used in the casting of this spell -Add one ki point to your pool -Add one spell point that is added to its own pool. This spell point can be converted into an extra spell slot equal to the amount of spell points used in it. -Gain maximum hit points equal to the roll of the hit dice (Or average) of the hit dice used for this spell. The fruit harvested can be consumed as an action to benefit the chosen effect. A creature can benefit an amount of times equal to twice its proficiency bonus. This boon ends if it is ever affected by the Remove Curse spell, the Greater Restoration spell, or dies.",
